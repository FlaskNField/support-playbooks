Support Triage Process

The Support Triage process is a daily (or near-daily) meeting designed to foster alignment between Technical Support Engineers (TSEs) and Engineering teams. The primary purpose is to review escalated customer issues, ensure progress is being made, and clarify next steps. This process improves turnaround time, deepens cross-functional collaboration, and strengthens the overall quality of customer support.

⸻

Objectives
	•	Ensure consistent progress on escalated support tickets
	•	Confirm classification of each escalated issue (bug or feature request)
	•	Drive clear ownership and next steps
	•	Improve support-to-engineering knowledge transfer
	•	Increase visibility across customer-facing teams

⸻

Participants
	•	Technical Support Engineers (TSEs): Present context and updates on escalated tickets
	•	Engineering Representatives: Provide status updates or next steps on owned issues
	•	Meeting Owner (Ceremony Master): Facilitate, timebox, and track progress
	•	Optional Attendees: Customer Success Managers, Sales Engineers, Product Managers, others with customer context

⸻

Meeting Format
	•	Cadence: Daily or at a regular time (15 minutes max recommended)
	•	Structure:
	•	Review by engineering team (e.g., Java team, Frontend team, Backend team, Security team)
	•	Each TSE gives a quick update on their escalated tickets
	•	Engineering responds with updates, blockers, or next steps
	•	Meeting owner facilitates, moves conversation along, timeboxes discussions
	•	Any ticket needing further discussion can be moved to a separate thread or follow-up call

⸻

Escalation Criteria

TSEs should only escalate tickets that:
	•	Have sufficient context and reproduction steps
	•	Include logs, environment details, and steps taken so far
	•	Are clearly customer-impacting and meet internal severity thresholds

⸻

Post-Triage Ticket Flows

Bug Confirmed:
	•	Ticket is confirmed as a bug
	•	Engineering team triages and assigns based on severity:
	•	Critical: Interrupts sprint
	•	Major: Enters next sprint
	•	Minor / Tech Debt: Backlogged for future prioritization
	•	Ticket status should update in the support platform when resolved

Feature Request:
	•	Confirmed as feature request
	•	Routed through Product Management + CS for prioritization
	•	Linked to any open Product feedback or roadmap items

⸻

Tooling & Workflow Integration

Required Fields (on Escalated Ticket):
	•	Customer Name / ID
	•	Ticket Origin (link to original support ticket)
	•	Severity
	•	Escalation Reason
	•	Owner (Support and Engineering)
	•	Date escalated
	•	Status (Open, In Progress, Blocked, Resolved)

Closure Codes / Resolution Statuses:
	•	Closed - Code Fix
	•	Closed - Docs Updated
	•	Closed - Knowledge Transfer
	•	Closed - Product Feedback

These should be selectable fields in your support platform to help categorize and report on escalation outcomes.

Ticket Sync Behavior:
	•	When an engineering ticket is resolved/closed:
	•	The linked support ticket should move to Open or Pending Support Follow-up
	•	The TSE reviews the outcome, follows up with the customer, and updates resolution status

⸻

Metrics to Track
	•	Volume of tickets escalated to engineering
	•	Average resolution time for escalated tickets
	•	Breakdown by closure code (Code Fix vs Docs Updated, etc.)
	•	% of bugs vs feature requests
	•	Engineering team responsiveness
	•	Knowledge base or documentation articles created as a result of triage

⸻

Best Practices
	•	Keep the meeting focused — side discussions should go async or to follow-up meetings
	•	Always include customer impact in the escalated ticket
	•	Encourage regular documentation of recurring issues
	•	Allow engineers to ask for more info, but hold support accountable to thorough initial investigations

⸻

Example Agenda
	1.	Quick greeting + recap (1 minute)
	2.	Go team-by-team:
	•	TSE presents ticket(s)
	•	Engineering responds
	3.	Identify action items + responsible party
	4.	Time permitting, summarize blockers or high-priority items
	5.	End on time

⸻

This triage process is a key part of delivering reliable, responsive, and transparent customer support. By embedding it into the support and engineering workflow, teams create more accountability, clarity, and momentum across the lifecycle of escalated issues.
