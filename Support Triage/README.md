# 🛠️ Support Triage Process

A regular (usually daily) meeting to align Technical Support Engineers (TSEs) and Engineering, review escalated issues, confirm classification, and drive faster, more accountable resolutions.

---

## Objectives

- Ensure steady progress on escalated tickets
- Confirm if each issue is a bug or feature request
- Assign clear ownership and next steps
- Improve knowledge transfer between support and engineering
- Increase visibility for customer-facing teams

---

## Who Attends?

- **TSEs:** Present escalated ticket context and updates
- **Engineering:** Share status, actions, or blockers
- **Meeting Owner:** Facilitates, timeboxes, and keeps meeting on track
- **Optional:** CSMs, Sales Engineers, Product, or others interested in escalations

---

## Meeting Format

- **Cadence:** Daily or regular schedule
- **Duration:** ~15 minutes
- **Flow:**
  - Team-by-team review (e.g., Java, Frontend, Backend, Security)
  - TSEs present escalated tickets
  - Engineers respond with status/next steps
  - Meeting owner keeps pace; long discussions move offline

---

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate a ticket only if:
- Context and steps to reproduce are clear
- Logs/environment info are included
- Customer impact and severity are documented

---

## After Triage: Ticket Flows

**If Bug Confirmed:**
- Prioritize by severity:
  - _Critical:_ Interrupts current sprint
  - _Major:_ Next sprint
  - _Minor/Tech Debt:_ Engineering backlog
- Support ticket is reopened or marked for follow-up after resolution

**If Feature Request:**
- Routed to Product/CS for prioritization
- May be added to roadmap or feedback backlog

---

## Tooling & Workflow

**Required Fields on Escalated Tickets:**
- Customer Name/ID
- Link to original ticket
- Severity
- Escalation reason
- Support & Engineering owners
- Date escalated
- Status (Open, In Progress, Blocked, Resolved)

**Closure Codes:**
- `Closed - Code Fix`
- `Closed - Docs Updated`
- `Closed - Knowledge Transfer`
- `Closed - Product Feedback`

Track these in your support platform for reporting.

**Sync Behavior:**
- When engineering ticket closes, update support ticket to `Open` or `Pending Support Follow-up`
- TSE reviews outcome and follows up with customer

---

## Metrics to Track

- Number of tickets escalated
- Average time to resolution
- Distribution by closure code
- Bug vs. feature request ratio
- Engineering team responsiveness
- Docs/KB articles created

---

## Best Practices

- Keep meetings short; use async follow-up for deep dives
- Always document customer impact
- Promote known issue documentation
- Ensure escalation readiness
- Encourage transparency across teams

---

## Sample Agenda

1. Quick intro/recap (1 min)
2. Team-by-team ticket review
3. Assign actions/blockers
4. Summarize top priorities
5. End on time

> This process increases velocity, clarity, and shared ownership between support and engineering.
