# Support Alerts Process

## Purpose

To establish a structured alerting system for customer support signals that require visibility and potential action. These alerts are sent to a shared Slack channel monitored by the support manager and relevant stakeholders to proactively manage customer experience, identify at-risk tickets, and ensure timely engineering follow-up.

## Alerting Philosophy

Support alerts serve as an early warning system. They're not just notifications ‚Äî they‚Äôre signals that something in the support environment requires attention, decision-making, or intervention. The goal is to:

- Maintain visibility into new and high-risk tickets.
- React quickly to customer dissatisfaction.
- Track the health and responsiveness of engineering escalations.
- Detect escalation signals in natural language.

All alerts are generated from systems like Zendesk, Salesforce, or other support tools, and are formatted and sent via Zapier to Slack.

**Slack Message Includes**:
- Customer name

**Slack Message Includes**:

## Implementation Notes

- Alerts are generated using a combination of triggers in Zendesk, Salesforce, or other ticketing systems.
- Zapier is used for formatting the message, enriching it with context, and posting it to Slack.
- Alerts should post to a dedicated `#support-alerts` or `#cs-ops-alerts` channel.
- It‚Äôs helpful to include emojis, flags, or tags (e.g., üî¥ `#critical`, üì£ `#csat`) to aid scanning.

## Maintenance & Iteration

- Alert triggers should be reviewed quarterly to ensure relevance.
- Consider adding suppression logic to avoid alert fatigue (e.g., suppress similar alerts from the same customer within a 2-hour window).
- New alert types can be added as the team‚Äôs needs evolve.

_This alerting system is intended to help teams stay agile, proactive, and aligned with customer signals ‚Äî not reactive or buried in dashboards._
